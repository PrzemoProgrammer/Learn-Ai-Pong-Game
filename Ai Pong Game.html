<!-- 

Hello, 
In this project you will learn how to create a Pong game against bot AI (artificial intelligence).

At start, we need to make small introduce and familiarize ourselves with the logic operators necessary to use in the project:

    LOGIC OPERATORS:
    && - its means "and"
    || - its means "or"


Below is the XY axis which mathematically shows the location of our game.

        (0,0)XY
        +---------------------------------- X 10
        |                 *(0,5)XY
        |    
        |    
        |             
        |*(-5,0)XY
        |    
        |              *(4,-7)XY
        |    
        Y 
        - 10

Point (0,0) is the starting point of our game, which means that it is the upper left corner of our playing field.

So our game on the XY axis looks something like this:

        (0,0)XY
        +---------------------------------- X 10
        |                 
        |     ---------------------------------
        |     |                               |
        |     |                               |
        |     |  |              o          |  |
        |     |  |                         |  |
        |     |                               |
        |     |                               |
        |     ---------------------------------
        Y 
        - 10

Understanding the XY axis is very important to effectively manage the arrangement and movement of elements in the game. 
When reviewing the game's code, if you come across code that changes the X and Y position of a player, bot or ball, come back here to better understand the movement.

First, we need to create HTML5 file and give a structure to our project.
This is the basic structure with which an HTML project always starts. An entire HTML document consists of two main parts: the header:<head><head> and the body:<body></body>. 
Below is an example of a full HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>

    <meta charset="utf-8">
